# Admin Access Guide

This guide explains how to access the admin dashboard for the Nexora website.

## Accessing Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard is not accessible through regular navigation links on the website. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access attempts.

### Steps to Access

1. Navigate directly to the admin login page:
   ```
   https://your-domain.com/admin-login
   ```

2. Use your admin credentials:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: adminpassword
   
   **Note:** These are the default credentials for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, we recommend:
   - Changing these credentials immediately after first login
   - Using a stronger password with a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
   - Enabling two-factor authentication if available

3. After successful authentication, you will be redirected to the admin dashboard.

## Admin Dashboard Features

The admin dashboard provides access to:
- User management
- Content management
- Site settings
- Analytics
- System configuration

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never share your admin credentials** with unauthorized personnel
2. Log out after each session
3. Access the admin dashboard only from secure networks
4. Change your password regularly
5. Report any suspicious activities immediately

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues accessing the admin dashboard:

1. Ensure you're using the correct URL (/admin-login)
2. Verify your credentials
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. If problems persist, contact the system administrator
